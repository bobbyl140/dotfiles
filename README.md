# dotfiles

My dotfiles for macOS. 

The only thing here so far is my SketchyBar config, which is horribly inefficient at time of writing. I will optimize it later.

In order to install, go into the folder for the configs you want, then the subfolder for the profile. Copy the folder in there to your `.config/`.
